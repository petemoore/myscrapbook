Notes for installation steps
============================
Give own user permission to issue tokens / redeploy relengapi
Issue token for inserting projects
Issue token for inserting mappings
Create ~/.passwords file
Manually insert projects using script one time
Configure git user, email
Do a github ls-remote using ssh to get known-hosts added
Make sure ssh key for github is on the machine with correct permissions and name
Install bin/lockfile
Create script to be called from crontab
Clone Mozharness one time, and check out correct tag/branch/revision
Make sure Mozharness has an "origin" remote (to handle "pip freeze" issue)


Improvements (aka ToDos)
========================
Get startup scripts in source control
Remove automatic git up for mozharness (raise Bug for Aki/Hal to know about it)
Move PATH into startup script from cron (raise Bug)
Puppetize vcs hosts
Add .rst files to mapper to describe API
Relengapi to have links to mapper RST docs
Test "since" functionality
Update wiki / readthedocs about e.g. API
Finish blog post (and maybe convert to wiki/readthedocs) about development setup
Fix email subjects not to say "successful" if they aren't, and improve wording in general
Introduce DELETEs, PUTs (?)
Rename directory from vcs-sync to vcs_sync in Mozharness(?)
New API method to read the full list of projects
MD5 check of full mapfile, and if wrong, drop and push all, and send warning email
Improve git pushing to have all branches/tags locally with correct name, and push --mirror (?)
Update Bug statuses (both bugs)
Promote to others (jmaher, aki, hwine, edmorley, ...)
Ask Dustin if correct security schema has been chosen
Differentiate between project with no hashes, and project missing
Remove sql in mapper and test_mapper (e.g. using 'git_commit like :cspatttern' clause)
Only push changed refs in vcs_sync rather than all (i.e. filter out non-changed ones)
Push mappings to a branch called git_hg_mappings in each repo
Create a repo will all mapfiles, and push to that
Retry if mappings don't get published (although will retry one min later anyway)
Email isn't sent if previous was successful but failed to either push mappings or add git notes
Sync up with johns regarding: https://github.com/Nephyrin/mozilla-git-mapfile
See if we can sync the git-mapfile on hg side, or have hg plugin to show git commit id
gecko-dev
gecko-projects
gecko-git
l10n
Investigate previous corruption issue

Other ToDos
===========
Fix Adium alerts not to switch windows!
Get Travis sending messages to irc #releng for mozilla failures and checkins (same as hudson)
Things
Remember the milk
Omnifocus
