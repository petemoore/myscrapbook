1) build devices.json from ssh'ing to machines, and diff results to actual devices.json
2) check for duplicate pandas/tegras
3) check for wrong passwords
4) split envs up to list their devices
5) work out which foopies are staging vs prod
6) investigate slavealloc db and propose changes to e.g. add foopy
7) fix python scripts to query for staging foopies instead of explicitly listing them
8) build status web page with overview of status of all devices, which are connected where, which have problems, what error message is, etc
9) check data in slave alloc is correct
10) check data in inventory database is correct
11) speed up grab_foopy_data.sh to do in parallel and not one scp session per file but per foopy
12) test new sut agent with my fix

stuff to check on foopy:
ps -ef
buildbot.tac
error.flg
disabled.flg
twistd.log
/builds/panda*
/builds/tegra-*
watcher version

masters:
twistd.log
devices connected to it
