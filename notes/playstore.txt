   ANDROID_VERSION_CODE make variable (first 10 chars, +1 for x86, +0 for arm7, -1 for arm6) (e.g. 2014080224)
   UA_BUILDID = date 20140802 (can be wrong date if it was midnight, then -1 for arm6)

nightly and aurora-nightlies are served by aus, and beta/release are served by play store
the aus updates are explicitly in-app update notifications, which is foreign to most android users aiui (since its its own update prompt, UI, etc) rather than the play store UX. Users also can't select "always update" with our aus updater

re: armv6/armv7 kim will be a good point of contact, specifically we *just* turned off armv6 builds on most trees


# chat with kim about disabling/enabling armv6

22:37:15 kmoir: until now i had been editing release-firefox-mozilla-esr31.py.template but i now think that was wrong, and i need to modify release-fennec-mozilla-release.py.template to disable armv6 builds, and i guess I need to create release-fennec-mozilla-esr31.py.template where i enable only armv6 builds - do you agree? (re: bug 1040319)

kmoir
22:41:06 I thought I disabled the armv6 builds in the templates when I turned off those builds, let me go look at that bug

pmoore
22:41:22 ah if you did it already, that is awesome, i didn't check already
22:42:31 kmoir: but i think  release-fennec-mozilla-esr31.py.template would be the right file for me to create to enable only armv6 builds, right?

kmoir
22:42:54 pmoore: right

pmoore
22:43:09 kmoir: cool, i just wanted to check i wasn't going crazy :)

kmoir
22:44:00 I disabled armv6 in the releases template in the bug that turned off armv6 https://bug1042835.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8465635

pmoore
22:45:54 kmoir: but does that also disable armv6 builds for esr31 branch?

kmoir
22:46:51 pmoore: there weren't any builds enabled for esr31 because we didn't have any android builds on android esr

kmoir
22:46:56 no android esr at all
22:47:06 so we would have to add those builders back

pmoore
22:47:21 kmoir: ah right - yes i think we might have to do that :/

kmoir
22:47:21 the platform definitions are all there

pmoore
22:47:34 shall we have a quick vidyo?

kmoir
22:49:03 sure let me login to your room
