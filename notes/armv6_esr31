22:37:15 kmoir: until now i had been editing release-firefox-mozilla-esr31.py.template but i now think that was wrong, and i need to modify release-fennec-mozilla-release.py.template to disable armv6 builds, and i guess I need to create release-fennec-mozilla-esr31.py where i enable only armv6 builds - do you agree? (re: bug 1040319)
kmoir
22:38:27 looks
hwine
22:38:47 see pmoore working at 2230 local on a friday night and realizes he'll be doing the same. Yay Releases!
pmoore
22:38:47 i mean release-fennec-mozilla-esr31.py.template (i.e. with the .template)
22:39:11 raises his glass to hwine
22:39:30 kmoir: we can grab a room if you like
hwine
22:39:32 ah, glad you know the rules for working that late on a friday!
kmoir
22:40:10 pmoore: let me think about that question for a bit
pmoore
22:40:32 kmoir: sure! hwine has inspired me to grab a beer - i'll be back in a bit
kmoir
22:41:06 I thought I disabled the armv6 builds in the templates when I turned off those builds, let me go look at that bug
pmoore
22:41:22 ah if you did it already, that is awesome, i didn't check already
22:42:31 kmoir: but i think  release-fennec-mozilla-esr31.py.template would be the right file for me to create to enable only armv6 builds, right?
coop
22:42:49 hwine: i’ve disabled b-2008-ix-0172 and am timing how long an |hg update| takes
kmoir
22:42:54 pmoore: right
coop
22:43:04 we may just need to bump the timeout today
pmoore
22:43:09 kmoir: cool, i just wanted to check i wasn't going crazy :)
kmoir
22:44:00 I disabled armv6 in the releases template in the bug that turned off armv6 https://bug1042835.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8465635
hwine
22:44:20 coop: as I read that, it's simply updating the workspace. There is no hg.m.o interaction I see -- those completed successfully above that
22:45:03 45 m to populate a local workspace sounds like something is broken, and a shorter timeout would fail faster :)
22:45:22 coop: and thanks very much!
pmoore
22:45:54 kmoir: but does that also disable armv6 builds for esr31 branch?
coop
22:46:40 hwine: one thing we might consider…i disabled all the b-2008-sm slaves today, so we may be getting ix slaves of unknown pedigree back into the mix
kmoir
22:46:51 pmoore: there weren't any builds enabled for esr31 because we didn't have any android builds on android esr
kmoir
22:46:56 no android esr at all
22:47:06 so we would have to add those builders back
pmoore
22:47:21 kmoir: ah right - yes i think we might have to do that :/
kmoir
22:47:21 the platform definitions are all there
hwine
22:47:24 coop: interesting -- I'll record all the slave names in the bug
pmoore
22:47:34 shall we have a quick vidyo?
22:48:18 (kmoir, i mean)
22:48:25 or is it a bad time for you now?
kmoir
22:49:03 sure let me login to your room
hwine
22:51:22 coop: when you're on that box, can you verify the version of hg being used, please?
coop
22:53:10 it’s 1.9.1
22:53:15 hwine: ^^
hwine
22:53:38 thanks, and OUCH
coop
22:53:56 if we want to ninja-deploy 3.0.2, i could script that up pretty quickly
22:54:14 i just filed bug 1056981 yesterday
hwine
22:54:31 let me check if that version could be an issue
22:59:14 coop: no known/fixed issues since 1.9.1 since we don't use (afaik) "unshare"
